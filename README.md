FutureSonic is a Madsonic and SubSonic fork. It is a web-based media streamer and jukebox fork of Subsonic. Based on Java technology, FutureSonic runs on most platforms, including Windows, Mac, Linux, OSX, and Unix variants. It's specially designed and being developed for http://sonic.lt project. Clients can connect via the built in website or with many other clients that support the Subsonic/Madsonic REST API. FutureSonic instantly transports your media to any HTTP(S) connected device regardless of bitrate. You can stream to multiple players simultaneously. FutureSonic is designed to handle very large music collections. By using transcoder plug-ins, FutureSonic supports on-the-fly conversion and streaming of virtually any audio format, including MP3, OGG, WMA, FLAC, APE and more.
